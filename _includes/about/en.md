Welcome to “Yihua Zhang’s Corner”!

This is my little digital garden—no cabbages here, just seeds of ideas and moments of curiosity taking root. I’m Yihua Zhang, an ordinary researcher constantly on the lookout for that next “eureka” moment in both research and daily life. Here, you’ll find me deep in thought, unraveling the mysteries of machine learning algorithms, or casually venting about the quirks of academic life. And no, this isn’t a diary—who keeps a diary these days anyway? 😄

🌟 About This Space 🌟
This virtual space is where I jot down ideas that make me go “Wow!”, technical deep dives, and insights I’ve gathered from papers and books. It’s more than a personal archive—it’s a chronicle of my growth and a place for sharing knowledge.

⚙️ If you’re into tech discussions, you’ll find notes on machine learning, LLMs, Trustworthy ML, and Efficient ML.
📚 If you enjoy reading reflections, you might just stumble upon something surprisingly engaging.
💡 If you’re hunting for inspiration, feel free to “pick” any interesting thought that catches your eye!

In short, this is both a garden of thoughts and a research lab in progress—where ideas are planted, pruned, and (hopefully) flourish. As for how fruitful it turns out? Well, that depends on my “green thumb” as a researcher. I hope this little corner brings you some joy, and feel free to drop a comment if you want to chat about those “aha!” moments that make life interesting!
